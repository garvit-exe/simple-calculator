# Simple Calculator with Tkinter

This project is a simple calculator application implemented using the Tkinter library in Python. The calculator provides a graphical user interface with number buttons, arithmetic operators, an equal sign for computation, and a clear button. Users can perform basic arithmetic operations and see the result displayed in a text area.

## Features
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.
- User-friendly interface with number buttons and operators.
- Real-time display of entered numbers and computed results.
- Clear button for resetting the input.

## Usage
1. Enter numbers using the numeric buttons.
2. Use the operator buttons to perform arithmetic operations.
3. Press the "=" button to compute the result.
4. Click the "C" button to clear the input and start a new calculation.

## Customization
The calculator layout is organized with numeric buttons, operator buttons, and a text area for input and output. Users can extend or modify the functionality by adding more buttons or implementing additional features.

Feel free to explore the Tkinter documentation for further customization: [Tkinter Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html)
